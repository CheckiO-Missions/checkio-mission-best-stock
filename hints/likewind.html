    <div class="answer">
        First of all, you can take zero (0) as the price of the most expensive stock. Then compare the price of the first stock with the variable
        that was assigned to 0, and each of the following stocks with the previous one. If the new stock turns out to be more expensive,  
        its price should be placed in the variable, which contains the maximum price, and its name - in the variable,  
        where the answer is stored (the name of the most expensive stock).
